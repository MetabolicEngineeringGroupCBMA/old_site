### Material solutions and equipment

* 1M [Lithium Acetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_acetate) (sterile) (LiAC) 10.2 g in 100 ml dH20 and autoclave. 
* 100mM Lithium Acetate (sterile)(Dilute the 1M with dH2O)
* Glycerol (sterile)

### Method

1. Day 1: Grow up your yeast strain in appropriate medium overnight. 
If YPD medium is used, grow approximately 1 ml for every 100 ml intended to inoculate the next day. 
If you are growing a yeast strain with a plasmid that needs auxotrophic selection, grow in appropriate 
YNB based selection medium about 20 ml for every 100 ml intended to inoculate the next day. 
Some yeast strains in selection media may take 2-3 days to reach saturation. 
You should grow just to the point of saturation.

2. Day 2: Innoculate for example 250 mL YPD which is enough for about every seventy-five 100uL aliquots 
of frozen competent cells. Scale up as needed. Inoculate to an initial OD640 to about 0.5 * 1E7 cfu/mL. 
The releationship between OD640 and cfu/mL depends very much on both yeast strain used and type of spectrophotometer. 
If you use a [GENESYS20](http://www.used-line.com/pictures/80/10356580_2.jpg) spectrophotometer and a 
CEN.PK yeast strain, we have found that and OD640 of 0.17 corresponds to 0.5 * 1E7 cfu/mL. 
Let the cells grow at least two generations to an OD640 of at least 0.68 if you started from 0.17. 
This takes about four hours at 30C for CEN.PK, but may take longer for other strains.

3. Spin down cells (? g for 5 min)

4. Resuspend in 0.4 volumes of starting volume (i.e 40 ml if you grew up 100 mL culture) of a 100mM solution of LiAC. 
Mix well, use vortex if necessary.

5. Spin down cells (? g for 5 min)

6. Resuspend in 0.2 volumes of starting volume (i.e 20 ml if you grew up 100 mL culture) of a 100mM solution of LiAC. 
Mix well, use vortex if necessary.

7. Spin down a final time and resuspend cells in 100mM LiAC with 15% glycerol to a final volume of 0.03 of your starting volume.

8. Dispense the cells in 100 µL aliquots in eppendorf tubes and put cells into a cardboard box.
Put the carboard box into a styrofoam box and allow to freeze slowly in –80C. 
The styrofoam box can be removed after the cells are frozen solid (~24h). 
Unlike E. coli competent cells, quick freezing in liquid nitrogen will severely reduce their competency.
