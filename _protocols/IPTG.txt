title: IPTG stock solution 0.5M
---

The molecular weight of IPTG is 238.298 g/mol.

1g IPTG dissolved in water to a total volume of 8.4 mL will give 0.5M final concentration.

The easiest way to do this is to add 5-6 ml water to 1g IPTG in a 15mL Falcon tube.
dissolve and add water to 8 mL and then add 400 ÂµL with a P1000 pipette.


Calculations:
-------------

n = m/M

n= 1/238.298 = 0.00419642632334 mol

n = V*C

C = 0.5M

V = 0.00419642632334/0.5 = 0.00839285264668 L = 8.4 mL
