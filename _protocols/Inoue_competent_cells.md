### How to prepare TB buffer

1. Prepare the solution:
            10 mM Hepes (or Pipes)
            15 mM CaCl2
            250 mM KCl
2. Adjust pH to 6.7 with KOH
3. Dissolve MnCl2 to have a final concentration of 55 mM in TB buffer
4. Sterilize the solution by filtration through 0.45 μm filter and store at +4°C
All salts should be added as solids, Add the MnCl2 *AFTER* adjusting pH or it will precipitate. 

### How to prepare competent E. coli cells

1. Inoculate 250 ml of SOB medium in a 2-liter flask (see Maniatis, Fritsch and Sambrook
   for SOB) and grow to OD640=0.6 at 18°C (or at room temperature) with vigorous shaking
   (200-250 rpm)
2. Put flask on ice for 10 minutes
3. Spin down cells at 2500 x g (i.e. 3000 rpm Beckman J-6B centrifuge) for 10 min at +4°C
4. Resuspend pellet in 80 ml of ice-cold TB and incubate on ice for 10 minutes, then spin
   down cells
5. Resuspend pellet gently in 20 ml of TB and add DMSO to final concentration of 7%
   (with gentle swirling)
6. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes
7. Dispense the cell suspension in 0.5-0.6 ml aliquots and immediately flash-freeze by
   immersion in liquid nitrogen
8. Store frozen cells at –70/-80°C
