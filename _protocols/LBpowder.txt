++LBpowder
[protocol:]
Revised 2012-02-06

A practical way of storing a LB stock in dry form (1).

Add the following components in a plastic bottle with a large cap.

for 5L media:
50g   peptone OR tryptone                                              
25g   yeast extract                                                    
50g   sodium chloride                                                  
(100g  agar for solid media)                               
(2g Protocol for ampicillin stock solution powder OR 0.5g Kanamycin powder when appropriate or a liquid
stock after microwaving)

For 500 ml liquid medium, take 12.5g (no agar!) or 22.5 g (with agar) of the
mix and dissolve in tap water in a 1L Schott bottle.

Heat for 3-5 min at full power in a microwave oven with the cap shut tightly.
If the media is not dissolved, repeat the heating step after removing the
pressure.

Do not put more than about 500 mL in a 1L bottle, especially important if the
media has agar.

This protocol works very well for LB-amp media, it seems that heating in
microwave oven does not inactivate the antibiotic.
