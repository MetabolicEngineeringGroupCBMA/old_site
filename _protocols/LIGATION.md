title: pYPKa cloning protocol
---

The first step is to prepare the pYPKa vector. Use a standard miniprep kit if available.
If the kit has an optional wash step for nuclease removal, use this. if you suspect nuclease 
contamination you can heat the plasmid solution to 80°C for 20 minutes.
The pYPKa preparation should be free from nucleases since these will eat away the plasmid from
the ends and facilitate the formation of empty clones.


#### Digestion
The digestion below is enough for ten ligations. It can be scaled up or down as required.
It is probably not necessary to add more enzyme even for a larger digestion.
It also probably better not to make prolonged digestions as this might increase the risk for 
damaging the vector from trace nuclease contamination.

- 6  µL water 
- 3  µL pYPKa miniprep
- 1  µL 1X Buffer AjiI [link](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/ER1941)
- 1  µL AjiI (5U/µL)

Incubate  5-15 min at 37C.
Inactivate AjiI by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min.
It is practical to do the above digestion in a PCR thermal cycler.
Put the digestion on ice immediately after the digestion has finished.

#### Ligation mix

mix the following on ice in the indicated order for each ligation reaction:

- 5µL water
- 2µL 5xLIGATION buffer
- 0.5µL ligase

for ten reactions the mix will be:

- 55µL water
- 22µL 5xLIGATION buffer
- 5.5µL ligase (1 U/µL)

Add the following in each tube (on ice):

- 8µL Ligation mix
- 1µL PCR product
- 1µL digested pYPKa

Ligation in room temperature for one hour or in the fridge over night or over a weekend seems to work well.
Ligation at 37C for 10-15 min is used in many protocols. It is probably NOT necessary to inactivate the 
ligase prior to transformation.

Make sure to include a negative ligation control, at least in the beginning of adopting the pYPKa cloning protocol.
Common mistakes are using too much vector and failing to remove all nuclease contamination.
