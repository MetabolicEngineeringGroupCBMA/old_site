Standard Ligation:
Prepare a ligation mix:
vector+buffer mix
5x ligase buffer(x)		6
H2O 					6
Digested vector 		1
total 					13

Divide vector+buffer mix into two Eppendorf tubes +/-:
								+		-
Vector+buffer					5		5		µL
insert 							5		0		µL
water							0		5		µL
T4 DNA ligase (400 u/ml) 		1		1		µL
Total 							11		11		µL
 
incubate for O/N at 8-16C in the cold room
Proceed with the transformation of the appropriate E. coli strain with 10 microL of the ligation mix.

(x)
Homemade 5x ligase buffer
250 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.6
50 mM MgCl2
5  mM ATP
5  mM DTT
25% (w/v) PEG 8000
vortex vigorously at RT after thawing

PEG 8000 at 5%(w/v) in the ligase buffer has been shown to improve the ligation
efficiency of blunt end DNAs.
The reference is a 1986 BRL Focus "optimizing DNA ligations for transformation"
Vol. 8 #1 (winter issue).
For the ones who cannot get this issue , the buffer was the following:

5x ligase buffer:       final
250mM Tris-Cl pH 7.6    50mM
50mM MgCl2              10mM
25% (w/v) PEG8000       5%
5mMATP                  1mM  
5mM DTT.                1mM

Aliquot and freeze at -20.
The conditions recommended for ligations of blunt end insert into vector DNA 
were the following:

1x buffer
1 unit or BRL T4 ligase ( BMB will do the same job)
vector/insert molar ratio =3 ( up to you to change it )
4 hours at room temp (23-26C) 
Dilute 3 to 5 fold before adding DNA to competent cells.

DNA Insert Ligation into Vector DNA (with T4 DNA Ligase)

In a microcentrifuge tube prepare the following reaction mixture:

50-400 ng	Linear vector DNA
			Insert DNA (use a 1:1 up to a 3:1 molar ratio of insert DNA termini to vector DNA)
2 µl		10X ligation buffer for T4 DNA Ligase 	
2 µl		50% PEG 4000 solution (for blunt ends only) 	
to 20µl		Water, nuclease-free 	
0.4-1uL     T4 DNA Ligase 	0.2-0.4 µl (1-2 u) for sticky ends / 1 µl (5 u) for blunt ends

Vortex the tube and spin down in a microcentrifuge for 3-5 seconds.
Incubate the mixture for 1 hour at 22°C (on the bench).
Use the mixture for transformation.

Note:
* If the yield of ligation product is insufficient, prolong the reaction time (overnight).
* DNA can be dissolved in nuclease-free water or TE buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.8).
* An excess of ligation mixture with respect to competent cells may decrease the transformation efficiency.

Ligation buffers are usually mixed from five simple ingredients. Only one,
however, has a major impact on the speed of the ligation reaction: Polyethylene
glycol.

If you do a lot of cloning in your lab you may at times wonder how to make your
ligation reaction faster, more reliable and at the same time much more
affordable. Even if you haven’t, keep on reading – it’s never a bad idea to
save time and money. I, for one, can think of a million things to do if I had
copious amounts of both these (unfortunately rather rare) commodities. Going to
the beach and drinking margaritas is usually at the top of the list. So, how
can you save both time and money to make that happen? The answer is so simple,
it hurts to look at it: go fast and go cheap!

There are a lot of expensive ligation kits out there. The so-called “rapid
ligation kits” are popular because of the added value that the ligation
reaction needs neither a controlled temperature, nor a prolonged incubation
time. Conventional ligation requires incubation over night at 16 °C. With a
rapid ligation kit you can get away with as little as ten minutes at room
temperature – dang!

True, these will save you time – but they won’t save you any money. Which means
you can go to the beach but you won’t be able to afford the margaritas! So, you
might as well stay in the lab and continue with your experiments.

Viscous buffer The reason why the rapid kits work is not because of some fancy
Speedy-Gonzales-ligase that is capable of doing what the regular ligase can’t
do. Turns out it is exactly the same enzyme, i.e., good old T4 DNA ligase.
Rather, the secret is in the buffer: because it is very viscous it slows down
the diffusion of the reaction partners, effectively mimicking the effects of
reduced temperature. This increases the chances of loose DNA ends matching up,
sticking together via their overhanging unpaired nucleotides and getting
ligated. Because the sample is not chilled the actual enzymatic reaction is not
slowed down; which is why ten minutes are indeed plenty of time for the
ligation to occur.

I have applied this protocol literally on hundreds of cloning experiments and
it didn’t fail me once. All we need to know, you might say, is the composition
of the buffer. Manufacturers of rapid ligation kits will rather cut off their
right arm than tell you what’s in it. Luckily, my sense of self-destruction has
not quite developed this far – which is almost surprising given that I have
spent the last fifteen years in research.

Mixture of lower mass PEGs The key ingredient that will make all the magic
happen is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG is an inexpensive polymer that is sold
as a dry powder. Depending on the average molecular mass, you can get different
PEGs, ranging from 3,350 g/mol to well above 20,000 g/mol. Usually, the lower
mass PEGs do well in this buffer.

Here is the recipe:

132 mM Tris, pH 7.6 with HCl
20 mM MgCl2
2 mM DTT
2 mM ATP
15% PEG (3350, 6000, or 8000)

This yields a two-fold concentrated buffer. Since the buffer contains ATP and
DTT it’s a good idea to aliquot and store it at -20 °C and avoid freeze-thaw
cycles. For an average ligation reaction I usually aim for a total volume of 20
μl, ligating 100 ng of purified vector backbone to three times as many insert
molecules. Hence, a typical reaction would look like this:

100 ng purified vector
3x molar ratio of purified insert
Add ddH2O to 9 μl
10 μl of 2x homemade ligation buffer
0.8 μl of T4 DNA ligase

Vortex briefly, collect by centrifugation and incubate at room temperature for
ten minutes. That’s it! Now you can chill the reaction on ice, add your
competent cells and proceed with the transformation. This also means that you
have just saved a lot of time and money.

Therefore, pack your beach towel, grab your swimming trunks and off you go to
“Margaritaville”. Enjoy!
