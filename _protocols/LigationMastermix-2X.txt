## LigationMastermix-2X

A typical ligation with pYPKa is:

5µL insert
1µL water
1µL digested pYPKa vector
2µL buffer
1µL enzyme

Thsi could be simplified to:

5µL insert
1µL water
6µL LigationMastermix-2x

where the LigationMastermix-2x is
2 µL water
1 µL acetylated BSA (10 mg/ml) http://se.promega.com/resources/pubhub/enotes/shorten-the-ligation-time-for-the-pgem-t-vector-systems/
2 µL 2 x ligation buffer 
1 µL T4 DNA ligase (5U/µL)
