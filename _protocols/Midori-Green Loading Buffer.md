### Midori-Green Loading Buffer (LBx2wMidori)

Midori green is one of many alternatives to EtBr. Midori Green is sold by [Nippon genetics](https://www.nippongenetics.eu/en/product/midori-green-advance).
This stain is compatible with blue-LED transilluminators which is an advantage to use if DNA is to be cut out of the gel due to the lower 
level of DNA damage.

Dilute the Midori-green advance solution 400x (5 µL in 1995 µL water). This solution can be stored in the fridge or frozen. Store in a light proof 
container, light could degrade the dye.

Reciepe for 2x concentrated loading buffer:

- 53.2 µL H2O
- 66.8 µL Loading buffer x 6
- 80 µL Midori-green 400x dilution
- 200.0 µL Total

This solution can be frozen and thawed. 

If you have many samples, spot a 5 µL drop of the LBx2wMidori buffer on a piece of parafilm for each sample.
Add 5 µL DNA containing sample. Add the mixture to the agarose gel.

This method saves time and chemicals (in particular Midori-Green) compared to post staining
and mixing the stain in the gel.
