How to perform transformation

1. Thaw competent cells at room temperature and immediately transfer to ice
2. Dispense 200 μl into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (This may be done already)
3. Add 1 - 5 μl of plasmid DNA in each tube and incubate in ice for 30 minutes
4. Heat shock cells without agitation at 42°C (temperature can be up to 52°C) for 30
   seconds and transfer on ice bath
5. Add 0.8 ml of SOC medium and shake vigorously at 37°C for 1 hour (tape tubes to
   rotating wheel)
6. Plate cells onto LB+Amp plates (50 μg/ml Ampicillin) and incubate them at 37°C over
   night

Transformation of frozen chemically competent E. coli according to Inoue et al
Thaw the cells on ice. One tube for each transformation.
Add DNA or ligation reaction max 10 µl for 200 µl cells.
Resuspend gently, do not vortex.
Incubate on ice for 30 min.
Heat shock 42° C for 45 sec exactly. 
Use a water bath or thermo-block with water.
Incubate on ice for 1-2 min.
Add 1 ml SOC or LB with 20 mM glucose ( 3.6 g/l glucose).
Incubate at 37° C for 1h with shaking.
Spin for 30s to pellet cells.
Remove all but 100-200 µl.
Add 20 µl Protocol for ampicillin stock solution (*1000 = 100 mg/mL)
Resuspend cells in the fluid.
Plate on LB plates.

This protocol was adapted from Inoue, H., H. Nojima, and H. Okayama. 1990. High
efficiency transformation of Escherichia coli with plasmids. Gene 96:23-28.

How to prepare TB buffer?
    1. Prepare the solution:
                10 mM Hepes (or Pipes)
                15 mM CaCl2
                250 mM KCl
    2. Adjust pH to 6.7 with KOH
    3. Dissolve MnCl2 to have a final concentration of 55 mM in TB buffer
    4. Sterilize the solution by filtration through 0.45 μm filter and store at +4°C
    5. (PS: all salts should be added as solids)

+++How to prepare competent E. coli (i.e. DH5 ) cells?
    1. Inoculate 250 ml of SOB medium in a 2-liter flask (see Maniatis, Fritsch and Sambrook
       for SOB) and grow to OD640=0.6 at 18°C (or at room temperature) with vigorous shaking
       (200-250 rpm)
    2. Put flask on ice for 10 minutes
    3. Spin down cells at 2500 x g (i.e. 3000 rpm Beckman J-6B centrifuge) for 10 min at +4°C
    4. Resuspend pellet in 80 ml of ice-cold TB and incubate on ice for 10 minutes, then spin
       down cells
    5. Resuspend pellet gently in 20 ml of TB and add DMSO to final concentration of 7%
       (with gentle swirling)
    6. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes
    7. Dispense the cell suspension in 0.5-0.6 ml aliquots and immediately flash-freeze by
       immersion in liquid nitrogen
    8. Store frozen cells at –70/-80°C
