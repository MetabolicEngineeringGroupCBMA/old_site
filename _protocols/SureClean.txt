PCR clean up kit

    Initial Step for achieving a pink-colored pellet:
    Add 6μl of pink co-precipitant to your nucleic acid sample and mix
    thoroughly for 30 seconds. For samples ≥ 200μl, increase the amount
    of pink co-precipitant accordingly, but never use more than 20μl.
    (Note: To ensure an efficient recovery, a minimum of 3μl of pink co-
    precipitate must be used)

1.  Add an equal volume of SureClean to nucleic acid solution and
    mix thoroughly.
  
2.  Incubate at room temperature for at least 10 mins.

3.  Centrifuge at maximum speed (best results at 14,000x g) in a
    bench-top centrifuge for 10 minutes and carefully remove
    supernatant by aspiration.
    (Note: Centrifuging for longer time leads to better DNA recovery)

4.  Add a volume of 70% Ethanol equal to 2x original sample volume
    and vortex for 10 seconds.
    (Note: For sensitive applications an optional second ethanol wash
    can be performed)
    
5.  Centrifuge at maximum speed (best results at 14,000 x g) in a
    bench-top centrifuge for 10 minutes, remove supernatant and air-
    dry to ensure complete removal of ethanol.
    (Note: Do not overdry the pellet)

6.  Resuspend pellet in desired volume of TE, water or any other
    appropriate buffer for downstream procedures.


Notes:
A.
    Apparent molecular weight of the DNA treated (agarose gel
    electrophoresis) may be higher if the washing-step with 70%
    ethanol step is omitted. For accurate MW assay, two washing
    steps are recommended after the cleaning procedure.
    
B.
    Nucleic acids to be purified must be ≥ 100 bp.

C.
    Easier visualisation of the pellet can be achieved with a pink
    co-precipitant which is supplied in the Bioline SureClean Plus
    (BIO-37047).
