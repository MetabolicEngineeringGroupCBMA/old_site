Deionized H2O, to 900 mL
Tryptone, 12 g
Yeast extract, 24 g
Glycerol, 4 mL

Shake until the solutes have dissolved and then sterilize by autoclaving for 20
min at 15 psi (1.05 kg/cm2) on liquid cycle. Allow the solution to cool to 60°C
or less, and then add 100 mL of a sterile solution of 0.17 M KH2PO4, 0.72 M
K2HPO4. (This solution is made by dissolving 2.31 g of KH2PO4 and 12.54 g of
K2HPO4 in 90 mL of H2O. After the salts have dissolved, adjust the volume of
the solution to 100 mL with H2O and sterilize by autoclaving for 20 min at 15
psi [1.05 kg/cm2] on liquid cycle.)
