title: Taq DNA polymerase purification
---

This protocol yields a Taq polymerase that is pure enough for most purposes that do not involve amplification of E. coli DNA
or some DNA that is common to pBR322 derived plasmids as there will be contamination with E. coli chromosomal DNA and the expression plasmid.
This can be resolved by allways including a negative control without template. 

1. Streak the Taq E. coli strain on amp plate (box: Bj√∂rn#2 position #9)
2. Pick a single colony and innoculate 2 ml SB
3. Grow O/N
4. Innoculate 500 ml SB with 1ml of previous culture
5. Grow to OD640 = 0.4
6. Add 1ml 1M IPTG (2 mM final conc)
7. Grow another 16-20 hours
8. Harvest cells and wash once with 100 ml Buffer A. (8000 rpm for 10 min 4C or fast and long enough to collect the cells efficiently) 
9. Resuspend cells in 20 ml buffer A + 4 mg/ml hen egg lysozyme added as a powder
10. Incubate at RT 15 min
11. Add 20 ml buffer B (add PMSF just before using the buffer)
12. Incubate at 75C for 60 min12.
13. Spin down debris at 25000 rpm 15 min 4C
14. Transfer supernatant to a clean tub, be careful not to transfer solid material
15. Mix lysate with an equal volume of storage buffer containing 50% glycerol.
16. Mix the diluted lysate with an equal volume of storage buffer containing 75% glycerol.
17. This brings the final glycerol concentration to 50% and diluting the lysate 4 times.
18. Note! Slow addition of both storage buffers (with mixing) is supposed to result in more units of Taq pol
19. Dispense the mixture in eppendorf tubes and store at -20 C.

Removal of DNA Contamination from Taq DNA Polymerase Preparations

The BioTechniques Short Technical Report which described the construction of
pTAQ and the single-step purification protocol also described a subsequent
method to remove contaminating DNA from the enzyme preparation. Since many
laboratories do not have access to an FPLC to carry out this subsequent
purification step, we have applied a much simpler technique to remove the
contaminating DNA. I would like to point out that the removal of the
contaminating DNA should not be necessary unless primers that might interact
with prokaryotic DNA are being used (such as with RAPD analysis). We have
recently used two different techniques that appear to both work very
efficiently to remove the contaminating DNA. The simplest technique is the use
of Millipore 300,000 MW cutoff centrifuge filters (cat. no. UFC4TMK25),
available from Sigma (cat. no. M-2411). The enzyme readily passes through the
filter, even in the presence of 50% glycerol storage buffer, while the
contaminating DNA is retained by the filter. Since it takes several hours of
centrifugation for the glycerol-containing buffer to pass through the filter, a
refrigerated centrifuge should be used (even though the enzyme is heat stable).
An alternative method to remove the contaminating DNA is the use of
hydroxylapatite. Ten grams of hydroxylapatite is washed and equilibrated with
10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol. Both
the enzyme and DNA bind to hydroxylapatite in this buffer. After applying the
lysate to the hydroxylapatite and allowing it to bind for 30 minutes, the
hydroxylapatite is washed with ten ml of the same buffer (10 mM potassium
phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol). The enzyme is then
eluted using 0.5 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 5%
glycerol. The process can be accomplished in a batchwise manner to simplify the
procedure, or can be performed in a column. The enzyme elutes from the column
at approximately 0.2 M potassium phosphate if a gradient elution is performed
rather than a batchwise process. Due to the very high concentration of the
enzyme, subsequent dilution into storage buffer eliminates the need for
dialysis. Significant loss of enzymatic activity is frequently encountered
during the dilution of the enzyme into storage buffer. This is why we recommend
a two-step dilution process as described in the BioTechniques report, and also
recommend performing both steps very slowly and gradually.
