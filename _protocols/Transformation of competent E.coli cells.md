Transforming Calcium Competent Cells 

1. Let cells defrost on ice (~15 min).

2. Add the DNA (5-10 µL)

3. 30 min on ice

4. water bath at 42°C during 45s

5. 10 min on ice

6. add 950 µL LB and let cells recover at 37°C for 1h

7. centrifuge >12000g during 1 min

8. discard ~900 µL of the supernatant, resuspend pellet with the remainig spernatant and plate cells.
