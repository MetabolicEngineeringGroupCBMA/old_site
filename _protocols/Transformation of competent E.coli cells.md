title: Transforming Frozen Calcium Competent Cells 
---

1. Let cells defrost on ice (~15 min).

2. Add the DNA (5-10 µL), flick the tube to mix.

3. 30 min on ice

4. heat shock in water bath at 42°C during 45s

5. incubate 10 min in a ice slurry.

6. add 950 µL LB and let cells recover at 37°C for 1h. Put the tubes sideways in a shaking incubator. Mixing is better in a 2mL tube.

7. centrifuge >12000g during 30 s or at lower speed (~5000 rpm for 2-3 min). 

8. discard ~900 µL of the supernatant, resuspend pellet with the remainig spupernatant and plate cells.
