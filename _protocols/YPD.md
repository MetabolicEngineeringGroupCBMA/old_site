+ YPD YEDP yeast extract peptone dextrose
[alias:YEPD]
revised 2010-03-04

This medium is for general growth of yeast strains. We use half of the original peptone or tryptone concentration.
see wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YEPD).

For liquid medium, add the following components in a 1L bottle:

- 10 g/L yeast extract
- 10 g/L peptone or tryptone (standard concnetration is 20 g/L )
- 20 g/L glucose

Add a magnetic stirrer and fill up to the 1L mark on the bottle. Ordinary tap water can be used for this
since tap water was used to produce the yeast extract and the peptone in the first place.
There is normally no need to setthe pH, should be around 7.

Mark the bottle "YPD". Autoclave with a small piece (1 cm) autoclave tape on the lid. 

This medium can be prepared in dry form and then mixed with water and heated using a microwave oven: [YPDpowder]

For solid medium, add the following to a 1L Schott bottle:

- 5 g yeast extract
- 5 g peptone
- 10 g glucose
- 10 g agar

Add water to 500mL and a magnetic stirrer. Autoclave with lid loosely fitted. Do not make more than about 1/2 L in 
a one liter bottle since the medium can boil over.

Reuse the plastic bag that the plates came from to store the plates.
