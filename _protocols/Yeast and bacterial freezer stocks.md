### Protocol for long term storage of yeast and bacterial stocks.
revised 2017-11-27

Yeast biomass from a range of sources can be mixed with glycerol to final concentration of 15 - 50 % (v/v) and frozen indefinitely at -80C.

The simplest way to freeze a yeast or bacterial strain is to inoculate a plate of solid medium and incubate it for 
one or two days at the optimal temperature of the strain.

Prepare as many screw cap tubes tubes with half of the maximum volume with appropriate medium or sterile water. 
If you are freezing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, YPD or some other YP based medium can be used even if the strains have plasmids. For E. coli LB medium can be used without antibiotics even is the strains carry plasmids.

Add one volume of 50% glycerol to each tube so that the final concentration is 25% (v/v). 
Transfer cells from the solid medium to the tubes using a large flat toothpick.
Take as much cells as you can.
Resuspend cells by vortexing and let the tubes stand in room temperature for an hour up to a day before freezing. This is for the glycerol to have time to enter the cells before freezing which may affect the survival of the cells.

Alternatively, grow strains in 1-5 ml medium overnight at the appropriate temperature with shaking.
Fill about half of the maximum volume of the freezer tube. Add 1 vol of 50% glycerol. Mix well.

Put the tubes in the -80 freezer and add the position and box name into list kept in the Google spreadsheet that we share within the group.
