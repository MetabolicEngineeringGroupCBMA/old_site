title: Yeast genomic DNA extraction with LiAc-SDS
---

1. Pick one yeast colony from the plate or spin down 100–200 μL liquid yeast culture (OD600 ~ 0.4).
2. Suspend cells in 100 μL 200 mM LiOAc, 1% SDS solution.
3. Incubate for 5-15 min at 70°C. We float the tubes in recently boiled water. 
4. Add 300 μL 96–100% ethanol, then mix by vortexing.
5. Spin down DNA and cell debris at 15,000×g or the maximum speed that the centrifuge allow for 3 min.
7. Remove supernatant by decanting or pipetting.
8. Add 1 mL 70% ethanol. Do not resuspend the pellet.
9. Spin at the maximum speed that the centrifuge allow for 30s.
10. Remove supernatant by decanting or pipetting.
11. Dissolve pellet in 100 μL H2O, TE or Elution buffer for any miniprep kit.
12. Spin down cell debris for 15 s or more at maximum speed.
13. Use 1 μL supernatant for PCR.
