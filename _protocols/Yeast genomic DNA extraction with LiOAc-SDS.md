title: Yeast genomic DNA extraction with LiOAc-SDS
---

1. Pick one yeast colony from the plate or spin down 100–200 μL liquid yeast culture (OD600 ~ 0.4).
2. Suspend cells in 100 μL 200 mM LiOAc, 1% SDS solution.
3. Incubate for 5 min at 70°C. We float the tubes in recently boiled water. 
4. Add 300 μL 96–100% ethanol, then mix by vortexing.
5. Spin down DNA and cell debris at 15,000×g or the maximum speed that the centrifuge allow for 3 min.
6. Wash pellet with 1 mL 70% ethanol. Do not resuspend the pellet.
7. Spin at the maximum speed that the centrifuge allow for 30s.
8. Remove supernatant with a pipette.
7. Dissolve pellet in 100 μL H2O or TE and spin down cell debris for 15 s at maximum speed.
8. Use 1 μL supernatant for PCR.
