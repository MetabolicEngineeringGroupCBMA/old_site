# Bradford assay in microplate 

Microplate analysis.


- Dilute 1mL of Bradford reagent in a total volume of 5mL with dH2O.
- Prepare a 1mg/mL BSA solution.
- Use the following concentrations for 6 wells.

| Well | Concentration | Vol.BSA(uL) | Vol.H2O (uL) |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1    | 0             | 0           | 15           |
| 2    | 1             | 1           | 14           |
| 3    | 2.5           | 2.5         | 12.5         |
| 4    | 5             | 5           | 10           |
| 5    | 10            | 10          | 5            |
| 6    | 15            | 15          | 0            |



- Use the further wells for your samples, use 1uL of your sample and add 14uL of dH2O (you may use duplicates/ triplicates)

- Add 200uL of diluted Bradford reagent in all the wells you used.

- Read the absorvance at 595nm in a microplate spectrophotometer

- Consult the Bradford Assay Calibration Curve:
