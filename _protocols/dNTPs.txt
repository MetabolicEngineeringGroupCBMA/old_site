[alias:dNTP][EXP:true]

I usually have used the 10 mM stock which is about x 100 times for a final C of 100uM in PCR.

I should make a stock that is 1 mM

PROTOCOL
There should be two stock solutions, 10 mM master stock and 1 mM stock solutions both stored at -20.

When the stock solution (10mM) arrives, thaw and aliquot into clean eppendorf tubes ~100uL each
save these tubes as master stock.

Dilute 100uL with 900uL ddH2O to make 1 mM stock solution. There should be one tube for each person doing PCR.
