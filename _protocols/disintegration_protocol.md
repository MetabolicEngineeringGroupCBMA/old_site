# Protein Extraction from S. cerevisae for activity measurements


- Prepare 50mL of fresh YPD in an Erlenmeyer flask (volume?).

- Start an overnight culture and let the cells grow for about 15h (for strain CEN.PK113-5D) in order for the cells to reach the stationary phase.

- Harvest the cells in a 50 mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 3000g for 5 min. at 4ºC.
- Wash the cells in ice-cold 0.9% NaCl (twice).
- Ressuspend the cells in 1 mL of NaCl 0.9% and transfer the suspension to a 2mL Eppendorf tube.
- Centrifuge the cells at 3000g for 5min and discard supernatant.
- Add 1mL (total volume) of desintegration buffer.


DISINTEGRATION BUFFER:

| Compound                     | Concentration | Stock Solution | for 50mL |
|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| TEA (triethanolamine) pH 7.0 | 100 mM        | 1 M            | 25 mL    |
| EDTA pH 7.0                  | 0.5 mM        | 50 mM          | 500 uL   |
| DTT                          | 0.5 mM        | 50 mM          | 500 uL   |
| PMSF (in DMSO)               | 1.0 mM        | 100 mM         | 500 uL   |


How to make TEA buffer ???

- Add glass beads, to the mixture, equal to the amount of cells (usually 100uL - 200uL), use a pcr tube (200uL)
- Intercalate between ice freeze and vortex ~1min (in each) for about 10min.
- Centrifuge the cells at 5000g for 5min. at 4ºC
- Harvest the supernatant into a fresh 1.5mL Eppendorf and store it at -20ºC till further use.
