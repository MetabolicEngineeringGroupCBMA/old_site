MW = 292.25 g/mol 

For 500 mL 0.5M EDTA:

- add 73.1g EDTA (acid) to a beaker
- add about 400mL ddH2O
- set pH with NaOH pellets slowly until starting to dissolve
- add liquid NaOH until pH is 8 (at higher pH EDTA is not very soluble.)
- add water to 500mL

The solution is stable for years at room temperature.
