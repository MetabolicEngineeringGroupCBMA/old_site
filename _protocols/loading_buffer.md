Component         | volume  | Concentration        |
:---------------- | ------: | --------------------:|
Ficoll            | 10mL    | 25% (w/v)            |
Tartrazine (E102) |  1mL    | ?                    |
Xylene Cyanol     | 10ÂµL    | 125 mg/mL            |


This loading buffer is compatible with PCR, add it to 20% of the final PCR volume or 
it can be added to 40% of a premade 2x mastermix.

Commercial yellow food coloring E102 containing [Tartrazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartrazine) can be used. 
In this case, exact concentration is not known, but can easily be measured using a spectrophotomer. 

PCR mastermix can tolerate 0.0025% Xylene Cyanol FF in the final solution. 
For example, commercial 1X Quick-Load Taq Master Mix has 0.024% Orange G and 0.0025% XyleneCyanol FF.

the resulting solution is about the same colour as the gotaq green x5 flexi buffer commercialized by Promega.
