title: Plasmid rescue from S. cerevisiae using a plasmid mini-prep Kit
---

This protocol allow the isolation of small quantities of plasmid DNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the 
subsequent transformation of E. coli (i.e. plasmid rescue). An alkaline lysis miniprep kit for E. coli is 
needed for this procedure. We have succesfully used the [Genelute]() kit and the [GeneJET]()

1. Spin yeast cells from 1-1.5 ml overnight culture for 30s.
or scrape some biomass from a plate (the fresher the better) and resuspend in 1/2 mL water.
spin cells for 30 s, Discard supernatant.

2. Add the amount of resuspension solution to the cells indicated by the kit.
Resuspend cells by vortexing briefly.

3. Add 200 µl of glass beads (about one full 0.2 mL PCR tube).
Optional, add 10 uL lyticase, incubate 20-30 min at 37C.
Beat or vortex the tubes for 3-5 minutes. 
For many tubes we use LBM big vortex for 5 min at 2500 rpm.
Go to step 4 as soon as possible.

4. Add the lysis buffer as soon as possible, the distrupton of the cells liberate nucleases that can digest the DNA.
If many preparations are made in paralell, put the samples on ice directly after point three. 

5. Follow the rest of the alkaline lysis miniprep kit protocol. 
It the kit has an optional wash step to get rid of nucleases, use this step.
Elute in a small volume 30-50µL
Transform E. coli with 10 μl of the eluted DNA
Save the rest of the DNA at -20C.


This protocol is more laborious than some simpler protocols, but we consistently get more transformants from this protocol.
