+ RAPID ISOLATION OF YEAST CHROMOSOMAL DNA
PROTOCOL
[chDNA/E.coli]
Wednesday, November 18 2009

The DNA preparation described in the Basic Protocol can be easily scaled up to
prepare chromosomal DNA for use in Southern hybridization analysis (UNIT 2.9A),
in vitro DNA amplification by PCR (UNIT 15.1), or Digestion and ligation
(UNITS 3.1 & 3.16) to clone integrated plasmids. This procedure is
significantly faster than other protocols used to isolate high-molecular-weight
DNA. Although the DNA is subject to shearing in this protocol, the resulting
DNA is of sufficiently high molecular weight to enable detection of 19-kb 
Digestion products by Southern hybridization analysis.

Additional Materials (also see Basic Protocol) 

TE buffer (APPENDIX 2)
1 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A (UNIT 5.5) 
4 M ammonium acetate solution (APPENDIX 2) 
100% ethanol 

15 ml FALCON tubes
Tabletop centrifuge 

++Prepare yeast cells 

1.Grow a 10-ml culture of yeast in YPD overnight to stationary phase in 50 ml
sterile FALCON polypropylene tubes (see Basic Protocol, step 1).

2.Spin culture 1 min in 5000 rpm in eppendorf centrifuge, room temperature or
chilled does not matter. Pour off supernatant, and resuspend cells in 0.5 ml
water.

3.Transfer the resuspended cells to an eppendorf microcentrifuge tube and spin
5 sec at room temperature. Pour off supernatant. This wash step in water
removes any remaining medium.

4.Disrupt pellet by vortexing briefly.

++Break open the cells:

4.Resuspend cells in 200 ul Breaking Buffer. Add 0.3 g glass beads (~200 ul
volume) Add 200 ul phenol/chloroform and vortex at highest speed for 3 min.

The phenol/chloroform is the LOWER phase in the stock container, the upper
phase is buffer. The amount of vortexing required can vary depending upon the
vortex used. Determine by microscopic examination the minimum vortexing
required for a particular machine to break 80% to 90% of the cells. If using a
multi-tube vortex rather than a single-tube vortex, the time of vortexing may
need to be increased up to 4 or 5 min to get more efficient breakage of cells.
However, longer vortexing can result in shearing of DNA molecules.

5.Add 200 ul TE buffer and vortex briefly.

6.Microcentrifuge 5 min at high speed, room temperature, and transfer aqueous
layer to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 ml of 99% ethanol and mix by
inversion.

7.Microcentrifuge 3 min at high speed, room temperature. 

8.Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 400uL TE buffer. 

++Degrade RNA contaminants and recover DNA 

8.Add 30 ul of 1 mg/ml or 1.5 uL of a 20 mg/ml solution (0.03mg) RNase A (free
fom DNase), mix, and incubate 5 min at 37C.
   
9.Add 10 ul of 4 M ammonium acetate (or 4 uL of 10M) and 1 ml of 100% ethanol.
Mix by inversion.

10.Microcentrifuge 3 min at high speed, room temperature. Discard supernatant
and dry pellet.
 
11.Resuspend DNA in 100 - 200 ul TE buffer. Yields of ~20 ug of chromosomal DNA
should be obtained. This DNA is ready to use for ++Digestion_ (UNIT
3.1), in vitro PCR amplification (UNIT 15.1), or Southern blot analysis (UNIT
2.9). For Southern blots, best results are obtained when 5 ul DNA (~1 ug) is
digested in a total volume of 20 ul. To amplify by PCR, 2 ul of DNA should be
used in a 50 ul reaction.
