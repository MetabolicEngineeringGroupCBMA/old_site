| DNA                     | Size         | Concentration | Volume |
|-------------------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Plasmid DNA             | -            | 50-100 ng/µl  | 15 µL  |
| Purified PCR products   | 150-300 bp   | 2 ng/µl       | 15 µl  |
| Purified PCR products   | 300-1000 bp  | 5 ng/µl       | 15 µl  |
| Purified PCR products   | 1000-3000 bp | 10 ng/µl      | 15 µl  |
| Unpurified PCR products | 150-300 bp   | 4 ng/µl       | 15 µl  |
| Unpurified PCR products | 300-1000 bp  | 10 ng/µl      | 15 µl  |
| Unpurified PCR products | 1000-3000 bp | 20 ng/µl      | 15 µl  |


Quantify the template concentration via agarose gel or a photometer to ensure accurate results.

1. Put barcode stickers on all tubes
2. Add 15 µl purified DNA with either of the concentrations given in the table above
3. Add 2 µl of primer with a concentration of 10 pmol/µl (10 µM)
4. The total volume of your premixed sample should be 17 µL

Send the tubes to:
