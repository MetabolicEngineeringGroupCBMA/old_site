# Low cost plasmid mini-prep from E.coli (Snik-protokollet från [TMB](http://www.tmb.lth.se))

updated 2018-03-02

1. Grow 1 ml of E. coli in a 1.5 - 2 ml Eppendorf tube at 37°C o/n. Two mL tubes are better, since mixing seems more efficient. Tubes can be incubated on the side at 200 rpms. Alternatively, streak about a quarter to half a LB amp plate with cells and incubate o/n.

2. Centrifuge at top speed for 30s - 1 min to recover cells. Alternatively, collect cells from at least 1/4 of a LB-amp plate using a toothpick with a flat end.

3. Resuspend cells in 200 µL of Qiagen buffer P1. Cells can be vortexed or cells can be resuspended by pipetting up and down with a P1000 pipette.

4. Add 200 µL of Qiagen buffer P2, mix by inversion about ten times. Be gentle and do not vortex the tube or the chromosomal DNA might fragment.

5. Incubate at room temperature for 3-5 min. Do not incubate more than 5 min, keep the time with you cell phone for instance.

6. Add 200 µL Qiagen buffer P3, mix by inversion about ten times. Be gentle and do not vortex the tube or the chromosomal DNA might fragment.

7. Centrifuge at top speed for 5-10 min. While centrifuge is running, add 1 ml of 96% - 99,5% ethanol 
   to a new clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube for each plasmid prep. 750 µL of Isopropanol can be used instead of ethanol.

8. Add 500 µL of the supernatant from the centrifugation to the ethanol and mix by inversion. If isopropanol is used, add as much as possible without touching the precipitate.

9. Centrifuge at top speed for 10 min.

10. Pour away supernatant.

11. Add 1 mL 70% ethanol. Some protocols specify cold ethanol (-20°C) but ethanol at room temperature works fine.

12. Centrifuge 1-3 min at top speed.

13. Pour away the ethanol. Be sure to remove as much as possible.

14. Dry pellet in speedvac for up to 5 min at 50°C or by letting tubes dry on the bench for 10-15 min.

15. Dissolve pellet in 50-100 µL Qiagen EB buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) or Sigma Genelute Elution Solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH approx. 8.0) or standard TE (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA)

## Usage

10 µL of this prep can be used for restriction cutting to spot correct clones. This DNA can also be used as template for PCR or to transform E. coli, yeast and probably most other organisms. This DNA prep can be purified using for a clean-up kit (for example Quiagen QIA quick PCR purification columns)
 prior to cloning.


## Notes

This procedure is based on the alkaline lysis procedure developed by Birnboim and Doly (Nucleic Acids Research 7:1513, 1979).

The procedure takes advantage of the fact that plasmids are relatively small super coiled DNA molecules and bacterial chromosomal DNA is much larger and less supercoiled. This difference in topology allows for selective precipitation of the chromosomal DNA and cellular proteins from plasmids and RNA molecules. The cells are lysed under alkaline conditions, which denatures both nucleic acids and proteins, and when the solution is neutralized by the addition of Potassium Acetate, chromosomal DNA and proteins precipitate because it is impossible for them to renature correctly (they are so large). Plasmids renature correctly and stay in solution, effectively separating them from chromosomal DNA and proteins.



## Solutions

### P1 
 
- 50 mM Tris-HCl (121,14 g/mol)
- 10 mM EDTA (292,248 g/mol)
- 100 µg/mL RNase A, pH 8.0

Stock solution:
- 1L: 6,057 g Tris + 3,722 g EDTA.2H2O ; adjust to pH 8,0 (HCl)
- 500 mL: 3,0285 g Tris + 1,861 g EDTA.2H2O ; adjust to pH 8,0 (HCl)

Working solution:
Add 0,6 ml of RNase (20mg/ml) to 100ml of resuspension solution store at 4°C

When the cells are lysed in the next step, the RNase will catalyze hydrolysis of all RNA molecules into nucleotides, but the DNA will not be damaged.

### P2

- 1% SDS
- 0,2 M NaOH (39,99711 g/mol)

SDS is an ionic detergent which disrupts cell membranes and destabilizes all hydrophobic interactions holding various macromolecules in their native conformation.  The high pH of the 0.2 M NaOH also denatures macromolecules by changing the condition of ionizable groups (ionizing certain groups and deionizing others).  The clearing you should see is because the cells are lysing.  The viscosity of the solution is increased by the increase in concentration of macromolecules in solution (a result of the cell lysis).

### P3

- 3.0 M Potassium Acetate (KCH3COO; 98,14 g/mol), pH 5.5

This is probably the key step in the alkaline lysis procedure. The low pH of the Potassium acetate solution neutralizes the NaOH and when the pH returns to near-neutrality then the macromolecules renature.  The proteins and large DNA molecules do not renature correctly however. They form hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogen bonds with each other non-specifically because the correct conformation of the molecule was not maintained during denaturation.  The plasmid DNA molecules, however, never really fully denatured because they are small circular molecules, which are supercoiled.  Even though the hydrogen bonds between base pairs were broken by the high pH, they reform correctly when the pH is lowered.  The large DNA molecules (chromosomal DNA) and proteins form precipitates because they bind to each other in a large aggregate but the plasmids don't precipitate because they renature correctly and don't become part of the large multi-molecule aggregates.  Thus plasmid DNA remains in solution while proteins and other DNA molecules precipitate.

### TE-buffer 


(1X): 
- 1mM EDTA (292,248 g/mol)
- 10 mM Tris-HCl (121,14 g/mol) pH 8.0

Stock solution:
- 1L (10X): 3,722 g EDTA .2H2O  ;  12,114 g Tris
- 100 mL (10X): 0,3722 g EDTA .2H2O  ;  1,2114 g Tris

TE buffer is commonly used to redissolve DNA because it contains EDTA.  The EDTA will chelate magnesium ions, which are a cofactor for most nucleases (enzymes which degrade nucleic acids).  If your DNA prep becomes contaminated with a nuclease (like the ones produced by the cells in your skin) then the nuclease will be inactivated by the fact that the magnesium cofactor is unavailable in the solution (because it is chelated by the EDTA).
