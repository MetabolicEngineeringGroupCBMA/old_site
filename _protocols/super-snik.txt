++ super-snik

+++Low cost plasmid mini-prep from E.coli (Snik-protokollet)

Grow 1 ml of E.coli in a 1.5 - 2 ml eppendorf tube at 37C o/n.
Centrifuge at top speed for 1 min.

Alternatively, streak about a quarter to half a LB amp plate with cells and incubate o/n.
Collect cells from at least 1/4 of a LB-amp plate using a toothpick with a flat end.

Resuspend cells in 200 µL of Qiagen buffer P1.

Add 200µL of Qiagen buffer P2, mix by inversion ten times.

Incubate at RT for 3-5 min.

Add 200µL Qiagen buffer P3, mix by inversion ten times.

Centrifuge at top speed for 5-10 min.

Add 1 ml of 96% - 99,5% ethanol to a clean 1.5 ml eppendorf tube while you wait for the lysis to complete.

Add 500 µL of the supernatant from the centrifugaton to the ethanol and vortex briefly. 

Centrifuge at top speed for 10 min.

Pour away supernatant.

Add 1 mL -20C  70% Ethanol.

Centrifuge 3-5 min at top speed.

Pour away the ethanol.

Dry pellet in speedvac for 5 min at 50C or by letting tubes dry on the bench.

Dissolve pellet in 50-100 µL Qiagen EB buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) or Sigma ES

10 µL of this prep is used for restriction cutting to spot correct clones.
Purify this prep using Quiagen QIA quick PCR purification columns prior to ligation.
