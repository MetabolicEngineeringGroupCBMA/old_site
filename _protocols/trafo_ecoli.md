1. Let cells defrost on ice (~15 min),  One tube for each transformation.

2. Add the DNA (up to 10 µL for each 200µL cells), flick the tube to mix. Do *NOT* vortex the cells at this point.

3. Incubate for 30 min on ice.

4. Heat shock in water bath at 42°C during 45s

5. Incubate for 2 min. min in a ice slurry.

6. Add 950 µL LB, SOC or LB with 20 mM glucose ( 3.6 g/l glucose) and let cells recover at 37°C for 1h. Put the tubes sideways in a shaking incubator if possible. Mixing is better in a 2 mL tube than in a 1.5 mL.

7. Centrifuge >12000g during 30 s or at lower speed (~5000 rpm for 2-3 min). Slower speed makes it easier to resuspend the cells.

8. Discard ~900 µL of the supernatant, do that 200-300 µL remains 

9. Resuspend pellet with the remaining liquid. 

10. Add the antibiotic if necessary, about 1µL of a 1000x solution to for each ml of plate medium.

11. plate by adding 5-10 sterile glass beads and swirl the plate to spread the liquid.

12. Dry the plates opened in a [Laminar air flow bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow_cabinet) if necessary.

12. Incubate plates inverted at 37°C over-night. No parafilm is needed.
