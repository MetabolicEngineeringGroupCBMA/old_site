1. Let cells defrost on ice (~15 min).

2. Add the DNA (up to 10 µL), flick the tube to mix. Do *NOT* vortex the cells at this point.

3. Incubate for 30 min on ice.

4. Heat shock in water bath at 42°C during 45s

5. Incubate for 10 min in a ice slurry.

6. Add 950 µL LB and let cells recover at 37°C for 1h. Put the tubes sideways in a shaking incubator if possible. Mixing is better in a 2 mL tube than in a 1.5 mL.

7. Centrifuge >12000g during 30 s or at lower speed (~5000 rpm for 2-3 min). Slower speed makes it easier to resuspend the cells.

8. Discard ~900 µL of the supernatant, resuspend pellet with the remaining liquid. Add the antibiotic to the cells and plate.
