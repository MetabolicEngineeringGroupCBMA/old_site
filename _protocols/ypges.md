title: YPGES medium

###Protocol for YPGES medium (Yeast Extract Peptone Glycerol, Ethanol Succinate) for yeast).

This medium can be used to test the respiratory capability of yeast strains. They seem to grow faster
on this medium than on YP glycerol of YP ethanol.

This protocol can be found on BIONET MOLBIO YEAST newsgroup in a 
post by [aidan weatherill](http://groups.google.pt/groups?q=YEPEG&hl=sv&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=809gfg%248r2%40net.bio.net&rnum=1): 

1.  Dissolve 10 g of sodium succinate (270.15 g/mol) in 500 ml of distilled H20
2.  Add 	 10 g yeast extract
			 20 g bacto-peptone
			 21 ml of glycerol (87% or equivalent)
3.  Adjust pH to 5.5 with 1 M base
4.  Add 20 g agar for solid medium
5.  Add distilled H20 to 1000 ml
6.  Autoclave
7.  When cool add 30 ml 95% ETOH and mix

We have found that yeast grow faster on this medium than ethanol or glycerol alone.
