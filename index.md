Welcome, We are the MEC research group,
a part of the research center
[Centro de Biologia Molecular e Ambiental (CBMA)](https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjhgeWevKLLAhUIQBoKHQfcDcAQFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcbma.bio.uminho.pt%2F&usg=AFQjCNERIO6tvOxPHIgk4DaE4Y5LivlEXQ&sig2=8-94NSGguCRjdxnoOm0cYQ&bvm=bv.115339255,d.ZWU).

We are located in the [Department of Biology](https://goo.gl/maps/JyphLrwBYejffwTx5),
[University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN) in the ancient city of
[Braga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga),
Portugal.

## Our focus

Our interest is metabolic engineering of baker's yeast
[*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)
for consumption of new types of substrates and production of new biotechnologically interesting molecules.


Specifically, we work on expanding the consumption of for efficient metabolism of new types of sugars as
[D-xylose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylose) combined with biosynthesis of
[fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid) and derived lipids.


This process is important in nature, since fatty acids are important parts of
fundamental structures such as cell membranes,
but also serve as efficient energy storage for many cells and organisms.


The process could potentially be used for the green production of fuels
and other chemicals in a future [green economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy).

## Tools

As the field of metabolic engineering grow more complex, there is a need for new tools to solve
different aspects of the process to increase throughput and


Methods for engineering and transferring entire metabolic pathways in and between *S. cerevisiae* strains.
We have developed a method we call the Yeast Pathway Kit, that produces short metabolic pathways for a given
number of genes compared to other methods.
