Welcome to the web page of the MEC research group. We are a part of the research center [Centro de Biologia Molecular e Ambiental (CBMA)](https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjhgeWevKLLAhUIQBoKHQfcDcAQFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcbma.bio.uminho.pt%2F&usg=AFQjCNERIO6tvOxPHIgk4DaE4Y5LivlEXQ&sig2=8-94NSGguCRjdxnoOm0cYQ&bvm=bv.115339255,d.ZWU). We are located in the Department of Biology, [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN) in Braga, Portugal.

Our interest is metabolic engineering primarily of bakers yeast [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae) for consumption of new types of substrates and production of biotechnologically interesting molecules.

## Current research topics include differenet aspects of metabolic engineering:

Methods for engineering and transferring entire metabolic pathways in and between *S. cerevisiae* strains. We have developed a
  method called the Yeast Pathway Kit, that produces short metabolic pathways for a given number of genes compared to other methods.

Fatty acid overproduction and secretion.

Metabolism of the pentose sugars *D-xylose* and *L-arabinose*, which are common sugars in plant derived biomass.

## We have created open source software:

**pydna** is a python library designed for simulation/documenttion of cloning and DNA assembly.

**seguid calculator** A small GUI for calculating [SEGUID checksums](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/278/version/1), mostly used for teaching.

**web pcr** PCR simulation [online](http://webpcr.appspot.com/)!

**mecplugins** A set of [WikidPad](http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/) plugins for molecular biology
