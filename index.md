Welcome to the web page of the MEC research group. 
We are a part of the research center [Centro de Biologia Molecular e Ambiental (CBMA)](https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjhgeWevKLLAhUIQBoKHQfcDcAQFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcbma.bio.uminho.pt%2F&usg=AFQjCNERIO6tvOxPHIgk4DaE4Y5LivlEXQ&sig2=8-94NSGguCRjdxnoOm0cYQ&bvm=bv.115339255,d.ZWU). 
We are located in the Department of Biology, [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN) in [Braga](https://www.google.pt/maps/place/School+of+Sciences+of+the+University+of+Minho/@41.5609887,-8.3955389,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x35003d3394a8ab81!8m2!3d41.561095!4d-8.395599?hl=en), Portugal.

Our interest is metabolic engineering primarily of bakers yeast [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae) for consumption of new types of substrates and production of biotechnologically interesting molecules.

Our current focus is the production of lipids and fatty acids.

## Current research topics include different aspects of metabolic engineering:

Methods for engineering and transferring entire metabolic pathways in and between *S. cerevisiae* strains. 
We have developed a method we call the Yeast Pathway Kit, that produces short metabolic pathways for a given 
number of genes compared to other methods.

Fatty acid overproduction and secretion.

Metabolism of the pentose sugars *D-xylose* which is common in plant derived biomass.

## Open source software:

**pydna** is a python library designed for simulation/documenttion of cloning and DNA assembly.

**seguid calculator** A small GUI for calculating [SEGUID checksums](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/278/version/1), mostly used for teaching.

**web pcr** PCR simulation [online](http://webpcr.appspot.com/)!

**mecplugins** A set of [WikidPad](http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/) plugins for molecular biology 

Look at our [software](software.html) page for further info.
