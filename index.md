Welcome, we are the MEC research group.
We are a part of the research center
[Centro de Biologia Molecular e Ambiental (CBMA)](https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjhgeWevKLLAhUIQBoKHQfcDcAQFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcbma.bio.uminho.pt%2F&usg=AFQjCNERIO6tvOxPHIgk4DaE4Y5LivlEXQ&sig2=8-94NSGguCRjdxnoOm0cYQ&bvm=bv.115339255,d.ZWU).

We are located in the [Department of Biology](https://goo.gl/maps/JyphLrwBYejffwTx5),
[University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN) in the anicient city of
[Braga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga),
Portugal.

Our interest is metabolic engineering primarily of baker's yeast
[*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)
for consumption of new types of substrates and production of new biotechnologically interesting molecules.

Our focus is the production of fatty acids and derived lipids.
This is fundamentally the conversion of sugar substrates like
[Glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose) and
[Xylose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylose)
into [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid).

This process is important in nature, since fatty acids are apart of fundamental structures such as cell membranes
and also serve as efficient energy storage for many cells and organisms.

The process could also potentially be used for the green production of fuels
and other chemicals.

## Current research topics also include different aspects of metabolic engineering:

Methods for engineering and transferring entire metabolic pathways in and between *S. cerevisiae* strains.
We have developed a method we call the Yeast Pathway Kit, that produces short metabolic pathways for a given
number of genes compared to other methods.

Fatty acid overproduction and secretion.

Metabolism of the pentose sugars *D-xylose* which is common in plant derived biomass.

## Open source software:

**pydna** is a python library designed for simulation/documenttion of cloning and DNA assembly.

**seguid calculator** A small GUI for calculating [SEGUID checksums](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/278/version/1), mostly used for teaching.

**web pcr** PCR simulation [online](http://webpcr.appspot.com/)!

**mecplugins** A set of [WikidPad](http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/) plugins for molecular biology
