We keep our public protocols in this [wiki](https://github.com/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA.github.io/wiki). Please

We keep private protocols in this [wiki](https://github.com/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA/genetic-work-in-progress/wiki) (*).

Primer sequences are kept in this google [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TfKUGfgoNLhM8fXh8LbT8TxDb_vpuViC37C-xepqJY8/edit) (*).

Record your frozen strains here: [MEC_freezer_list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqhkhCqclrUXF75M1uVdcez7PdsAuJ64UBSVO6MXB1Q/edit#gid=1901694203)

Location and names of all boxes in -80 freezer [DEEPFREEZER 8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqhkhCqclrUXF75M1uVdcez7PdsAuJ64UBSVO6MXB1Q/edit#gid=1467824477).
This freezer is located next to the aquarium.

Do you need a short name for your plasmid? Record it here and get a π number. You can for example call
your plasmid π43 which is short and easy to search for on your
computer [MECPlasmidNames](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqhkhCqclrUXF75M1uVdcez7PdsAuJ64UBSVO6MXB1Q/edit#gid=1698645724)


Define your initials in order to deposit in the -80°C freezer here: [Depositors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqhkhCqclrUXF75M1uVdcez7PdsAuJ64UBSVO6MXB1Q/edit#gid=912966047)

Please record when you make new competent cells. This is so that we can trace competency. [Competent cells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqhkhCqclrUXF75M1uVdcez7PdsAuJ64UBSVO6MXB1Q/edit#gid=964731213)


Please record here when you make new Taq polymerase. [Taq](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqhkhCqclrUXF75M1uVdcez7PdsAuJ64UBSVO6MXB1Q/edit#gid=176499668)


Please record here when you make new ladder. [PennStateLadder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqhkhCqclrUXF75M1uVdcez7PdsAuJ64UBSVO6MXB1Q/edit#gid=1457101389)


These primers were used by the Yeast Genome Deletion project. There are errors in this table, make sure
to check primers before ordering [Yeast Genome Deletion Primers and PCR product Sizes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVlMkCKb6iX-w-2Q3OP2iP0UMH72PEHf9TuGM4SdRZk).
